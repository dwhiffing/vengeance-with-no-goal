BUG: fix assisting moving sprite over after moving back

parry sound is annoying
after each fight restore health by 25%
players dont explode after death
make buttons bigger when selected, potential overlay?
highlight currently active player
allow going back in ui
make heal by 50%
dont allow assisting if other players are dead
entities dont switch to death animation if defending
when using protect ability, take 1 effectiveness damage
sometimes you can take decimal damage
add spacebar for titlescreen to start playing
add button for credits
music not working in safari, maybe because ogg?
reset action index to 0 at start of player turn
damage done by enemies should be proportional to health

add mobile controls
  arrows on left, select on rightÔúè

different timings for every entity for attack and defense?
make window for defense bigger?
improve tweens and refactor them?

add title menu
  buttons for credits, start

add high score menu?
  add local high scores
  add online high scores
